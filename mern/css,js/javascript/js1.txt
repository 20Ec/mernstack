A scripting language is a type of programming language designed to automate tasks, often within a specific environment like a web browser, operating system, or software application.

 Unlike compiled languages (like C or Java), scripting languages are typically interpreted line-by-line, making them faster to write, test, and modify

- What Is ECMAScript?
ECMAScript is the standardized scripting language specification defined by ECMA-262, maintained by Ecma International. It serves as the core language behind JavaScript, ActionScript, and other implementations.


Think of ECMAScript as the blueprint—it defines the syntax, types, statements, keywords, operators, and built-in objects like Array, Object, Function, etc.


- javascript 

JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted programming language that powers the interactive behavior of websites and web apps. It’s the engine behind dynamic content, user interactions, and real-time updates in the browser.


Originally developed by Brendan Erich in 1995, JavaScript has evolved from a simple scripting tool into a full-fledged ecosystem used for both client-side and server-side development
